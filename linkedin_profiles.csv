"Lead Analyst (Healthcare Data Analytics)","Singapore","500+ connections","I am embarking on a journey in using data to improve our healthcare in Singapore.



I am currently working in the Ministry of Health (Singapore) to support the data analytical work in the ministry. Prior to this adventure, I was a business analyst for 6 years in a local SME.



Also, I have completed a Master of IT in Business (Analytics) from Singapore Management University in Aug 2017 (2 year part-time). I have graduated with a GPA 4.0/4.0 (Dean List) and awarded with IMDA Gold Medal Award 2018.



Now, I am focusing on continuous learning in the areas of data science - especially in these areas of data visualizations, big data management, machine learning, web development, and their applications.



I believe that a person's character, attitude, and skill & knowledge will define the true value of one's worth. Success is not defined by how much one has gained for oneself, but instead; how much one has given back to the community.

"Market Data Analyst at Bloomberg LP","Singapore","500+ connections","In 2017, I embarked on a solo road trip in the Scottish Highlands. Everybody thought I was mad; I hadn't driven a car in 10 years and nobody really thought of me as the independent, adventurous type. How could I possibly survive on my own in the unpredictable Scottish weather?



I completed it in the same way I approach everything in life. I am an experience-seeker with a can-do attitude: if something piques my curiosity, no matter how tough, I explore it with full belief that I can succeed. That is how I conquered the hike to the Old Man of Storr in bitter rain and wind, how I took up muay thai and rugby despite not being the most sporty person around and how I taught myself basic coding in Python while managing a busy work schedule.



Now, I embark on a career switch to data analytics with the same attitude. Coming from a completely different background, this step in my career may appear to be a daunting task, not dissimilar to climbing a steep rocky hill in the cold battered by wind and rain.

Equipped with strong statistical analysis and modeling skills, I am genuinely passionate about data analytics and technology. For final year project, I developed the statistical models to handle data truncation associated with physical activity data in public health studies. Besides, I am proficient in programming languages and analysis tools such as Excel VBA, R, Matlab, Python and SQL. As Data Analytics Intern at Canon Singapore, I have developed a business analysis tool to visualize the historical business trends across regions and products as well as facilitate the decision making at the divisional level. Despite unfamiliarity with organization’s business models and data structures, I worked closely with the team, learned the business needs and requirements from the internal stakeholders and completed the project which was nominated for Breakthrough Award within 5 weeks.



I am a self-driven team player, who aspires to improve the processes through digitalization and automation, implement the changes and solve the business challenges in the ever-changing environment.



My peers know me as a team-oriented individual who always put the team's interest first. I can (and often do) work well individually, but I am at my best collaborating with others. I do my best work when I'm challenged and empowered to take the ownership of the tasks.","[{'title': 'Business Analytics Analyst', 'company': 'Citi', 'duation_date': 'Apr 2019 – Present', 'duration_length': '6 mos', 'description': 'Nil'}, {'title': 'Senior Data Analyst', 'company': 'Shopee', 'duation_date': 'Jan 2019 – Apr 2019', 'duration_length': '4 mos', 'description': '✔Engaged in user behaviour analysis and worked closely with Product Managers to enhance the product features as well as improve user experiences continuously with data-driven solutions across Southeast Asia and Taiwan markets\n✔Familiar with big data analytics and platforms like Spark, Hadoop, Hadoop Distributes File System (HDFS), Hive and Presto\n\nTechnologies and tools used: Python, SQL, Spark, Hive, Amazon Redshift, Oozie, Git, Presto, Airbnb Superset, Airflow, Hadoop, Jira, Confluence and Excel VBA.'}, {'title': 'Data Analyst', 'company': 'Shopee', 'duation_date': 'Jan 2017 – Dec 2018', 'duration_length': '2 yrs', 'description': 'Nil'}, {'title': 'Teaching Assistant (Part-time)', 'company': 'Nanyang Technological University, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences', 'duation_date': 'Aug 2016 – Nov 2016', 'duration_length': '4 mos', 'description': '• Enhanced the teaching and learning processes effectively with engagement of students who faced difficulties\n• Acquired time-management and interpersonal skills by providing teaching support to main instructor in the Matlab programming class for 50 students\n• Noticed improvements in students by encouraging active learning and guiding students through the thought processes in problem solving See less'}, {'title': 'Data Analytics Intern', 'company': 'Canon Singapore Pte Ltd', 'duation_date': 'May 2016 – Jul 2016', 'duration_length': '3 mos', 'description': '• Nominated for Canon Singapore Breakthrough Award on project delivered within 5 weeks\n• Developed business analysis tool with predictive analytics which improved decision-making at regional level\n• Increased productivity by 40% through business reporting automation coded in VBA and Macro\n• Identified and resolved data population and accuracy issues which lead to high reliability of data analysis\nSee less'}, {'title': 'Peer Tutor (Part-time)', 'company': 'Nanyang Technological University, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences', 'duation_date': 'Sep 2015 – May 2016', 'duration_length': '9 mos', 'description': '• Provided academic assistance to weaker juniors to realize their full potential\n• Achieved moderate success to motivate and encourage juniors facing academic difficulties\n• Enabled juniors to understand the mathematics concepts via peer tutoring'}]","[{'school': 'Nanyang Technological University', 'type': 'BSc (Hons) in Mathematical Sciences (Business Analytics)', 'course': 'Mathematics and Statistics', 'duration': '2013 – 2017', 'description': 'Final Year Project : Copula Models for Truncated Data, with Applications to Analysis of Physical Activity Levels'}, {'school': 'Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ledang (Ledang National Secondary School)', 'type': 'Malaysia Higher School Certification (STPM)', 'course': 'Science Stream', 'duration': '2011 – 2012', 'description': 'Nil'}]","[{'name': 'NICF - Advanced Customer Analytics', 'provider': 'Institute of Systems Science, National University of Singapore'}, {'name': 'Intro to Python for Data Science Course', 'provider': 'DataCamp'}, {'name': 'Bloomberg Market Concepts', 'provider': 'Bloomberg LP'}]","['Python', 'Apache Spark', 'Data Analysis', 'Business Intelligence', 'Statistics', 'Business Analysis', 'VBA', 'R', 'Microsoft Excel', 'Microsoft Word', 'Microsoft Powerpoint', 'Microsoft Access', 'SAS', 'C++', 'Matlab', 'SQL', 'PowerPoint', 'Hive', 'Macro', 'Amazon Redshift', 'Presto']"

"| Data Analyst | Business Analyst | IT Systems Analyst | Computational Analytics |","Singapore","386 connections","My name is Harul and I currently work with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore as an Executive IT Systems Analyst managing a suite of IT projects dealing with Big Data IT Infrastructure and Data Analytics. Having built my long career of over a dozen years with over 9 years of mid-management experience in handling team operations and administrative functions in the public and private sectors and over 3 years of experience in the IT industry in social media analytics, software engineering and project management and having self-funded both my degrees at my own expense, I have had personally experienced and overcame various challenges of financial constraint, social discrimination and degenerative belief systems of success both at home and in society.



The sum total of all these experiences was humbling and had given me excellent leadership and team management skills with a personal credo that “true leaders don’t just inspire to galvanise hordes of followers, but act to create great leaders out of their inspired followers”. In leading teams, I see potential over weakness, engagement over authority and support over neglect in my teams.



Being a leader, I am fervently passionate to learn and grow beyond the confines of my professional knowledge and a firm believer that one has to acquire proper training or knowledge by any means possible to deliver to the fullest of one’s ability of the task in any job. As a systems analyst, I am highly trained and skilled in implementing, evaluating technical and functional aspects in IT project deliverables. I am also highly proficient in presenting and explaining technical reports and project updates in both functional and technical capacities to C-suite leaders and team members. I also possess sound theoretical and practical knowledge in computer science, neuroeconomics, marketing, public policy, information science, communications, strategy and business management and look forward to running my own enterprise one day.","[{'title': 'Executive IT Systems Analyst (Data Engineering, Big Data Analytics, Big Data Cloud Infrastructure)', 'company': 'Land Transport Authority

Along with my various work experiences and internships, I would not be a complete person without two things - arts and adventure. Be it being a child artist in various drama shows, debating at a National level in my secondary school, being part of the choir for 4 years, learning the keyboard under Trinity guildhall for 8 years, getting trained in classical Indian dance or getting one of my short stories published when I was 16, I am a true admirer the arts. Also, being an adrenaline junkie, I would go to any extent to try the most extreme and uncomfortable activities, just for the experience. Some examples would be my attempt at the world's tallest bungee jump in Macau, despite my fear of heights, or my one month of living alone in one of India's most unsafe city for women.

AKEOS system includes several modules:



- Text crawling: Extract only the text from webpages and save them to database

- Feature word selection: An Enhanced TF-IDF algorithm is proposed to select the useful feature words

- Relevant sentence selection: Using the feature word to select the most relevant sentences from the crawled corpus with the help of word embedding

- Entity extraction: Extract entities from a relevant sentence such as person, organization, date, quantitative words, etc

- Building knowledge graph



Above processes are all conducted in an unsupervised way which requires no human intervention, unstructured text is transformed into a structured graph.



With similar accumulated query results, AKEOS can also build Bayesian Network from them to perform causal inference. The Bayesian Network module consists:



- Candidate node selection

- Generating CPT: CPT for each candidate node is generated automatically from database

Project 1 (Based on http://hobergphillips.usc.edu/industryconcen.htm)



Using large-scale text mining of SEC filings and integrating momentum-based trading strategies, we built and evaluated a trading strategy. My contribution includes text mining pipeline implementation using Spark (Python, Java, Topic Modelling/LDA). Using topic modeling, we were able to identify latent relationships between companies (competitors/similar) using their product and business descriptions. This information is value added over the standard GICS classification of companies which is static and does not model the ever changing business world. I also performed deep dive analysis and prepared a case-study into the construction and behavior of text-mining & momentum-based trading signal.



Project 2:

POC to evaluate Bloomberg’s New Analytics and Event Driven Feed product for alpha generation.



Data feed included 2-years of story and company level sentiment analytics scores along with raw news feed which can be used for alpha research.



Signal Research related work:

Implemented the data cleaning and preparation pipeline for Bloomberg XML feed.

Implemented data exploration/analysis & sentiment-based interday strategy.

Implemented the backtesting framework on Spark and evaluated signal performance/returns over parameter space (region, holding period, sectors, etc.)

Data visualization is vital for this purpose, particularly in tackling fuzzy problems that require an explorative process of discovery to re-frame. This research investigates how data visualization can be used to harness big data for domain specific challenges in urban studies. To address this question, I demonstrate the utility of data visualization in four different case studies and developed a framework to compare their outcomes from design to application.

From paintings to digital imaging, this act is dictated in a linear sequence. Digital software today aids this process but much remains unchanged in the way form is assembled. This process is inherently limited to one’s intention and the capability of software functionalities. Form-finding, on the contrary, involves an emergent process. No explicit decisions are considered or made resulting in derived rather than imposed outcomes. In this thesis, I describe a series of experimental software developed to escape from such limitations. These programmes are simulations of processes intended to find and refine form. Applying simple rules, an emergent aesthetic is derived from the interactions which surpass intentionality and the conventions of commercial software functionalities.

Although my main focus is data analysis, I have experience on leading small groups of data scientists and organizing internal training.



Believing, the present and future of data science is based on network analysis and AI, I work with Lynx, who do both. I am trying to grow up to these new challenges via learning continuously. Currently I am focusing on developing my leader skills, due to I would like to build a small, enthusiastic and very well skilled data science team in the near future.





Feel free to ask me about the following topics

 Identifying Influencers and opinion leaders, creating influence graph (both Telco and banking)

 Using python & Spark for data mining

 Using geo-pandas and OSM for supporting Customer micro-segmentation

 Creating Single Customers View and Single Household View over SIM cards (both in prepaid / postpaid marked, both in developed and 3rd world countries)

 Classifying Social Connections among Customers (how to distinguish friendship from colleagues, family members etc.)

 Supporting and Optimizing Campaigns: e.g. how to build product affinity and channel sensitivity models, or how to handle revenue cannibalization.

 How to improve current Churn or Attrition models with Graph Theory

"Head of Data Science (Machine Learning and Maps) at Grab","Singapore","500+ connections","As the head of Data Science for Machine learning and the Maps team, I am excited about bringing research outcomes from the arena of machine learning, and artificial intelligence into live products that reaches customers' hands and delights them. I have successfully built and managed large data science teams, researchers, Post-docs, PhD students and software engineers in building AI centric products.



Research: My research interests are broadly in the areas of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I have several years of experience working on Bayesian Inference, Topic/Graphical models, Deep learning models. I have co-authored nearly 25 papers that were accepted in top peer-reviewed conferences and journals including IJCV, TPAMI, and conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, and BMVC etc.



Education: I completed my Ph.D at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland in August 2012. For my doctoral thesis, I worked on the problem of unsupervised activity analysis from long term sensors logs, with a special focus on data coming from video streams. The models developed in my Ph.D were tested and demonstrated using videos from several metro stations across Europe. This was done in the context of a European union project called VANAHEIM (www.vanaheim-project.eu).



Prior to my PhD, I worked at HP Labs and GE Global research, Bangalore, India, from 2005 to 2008, where I contributed to several projects in document image analysis, online handwriting recognition, medical image analysis and information retrieval.



Speaker: Spoken in various conferences and international forums
